```

### Data Flow Patterns
1. **Authentication Flow**: 
   - Login → JWT token → Store token → API client setup → Dashboard access
2. **Real-time Updates Flow**: 
   - WebSocket connection → Event subscriptions → State updates → Component re-renders
3. **Dashboard Data Flow**: 
   - Component mount → API queries → Loading states → Data display → Real-time updates
4. **Form Interaction Flow**: 
   - Form input → Validation → API submission → Success/error handling → State updates

### Component Architecture
- **App Router**: Next.js 14+ app directory structure
- **State Management**: Zustand for global state, React Hook Form for forms
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS with shadcn/ui component library
- **Real-time**: Socket.IO client for WebSocket connections

## SLOs & Scaling Notes

### Service Level Objectives
- **Availability**: 99.9% uptime (critical for business operations)
- **Latency**: 
  - Page loads: < 2s (P95)
  - API calls: < 1s (P95)  
  - Real-time updates: < 100ms (P95)
  - Form submissions: < 500ms (P95)
- **Throughput**: 
  - 1000 concurrent users
  - 50,000 page views/day
  - 10,000 real-time events/hour
- **Performance**: Lighthouse score > 90 for all core pages

### Performance Characteristics
